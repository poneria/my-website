# My website
Using my HTML, CSS, & JS skills to create my own [landing page](http://www.mro-writing.com). I'm still learning HTML/CSS/JS and building this website, so excuse the mess and template-y blurbs.

Check out [my WIP project board](https://github.com/poneria/my-website/projects/1) for what I'm working on.
