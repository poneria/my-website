				<span class="card-title">D&D</span>
				<p>I currently play a level 13 dwarf monk in the Way of the Four Elements in a 5e local game. She's a fire monk who, with a bit of homebrew, can swap the elemental damage according to specific elements activated by her handwraps.</p>

				<span class="card-title">MMOs</span>
				<p>I currently play <i>Guild Wars 2</i>. I raid once per week on my heal Druid (Ranger), though I started with my Elementalist as a Weaver spec. I like jumping puzzles and completing collections. I've played <i>World of Warcraft</i> as an Affliction Warlock and Guardian Druid previously.</p>

				<span class="card-title">PC Games</span>
				<p>Before I was introduced to MMOs, I played a lot of RPG series on the PC, including <i>Icewind Dale</i>, <i>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</i>, and the <i>Myst</i> series. My favorite <i>Might and Magic</i> game was probably the 3 & 4 combo <i>World of Xeen</i>.</p>

				<span class="card-title">Critical Role</span>
				<p>I'm not always up-to-date on the latest episode of Campaign 2, since I have to go to bed halfway through an episode now, but I don't mind spoilers. I loved Campaign 1 and probably won't shut up about it. I also love other shows the CR team is producing, like <i>Between the Sheets</i> and <i>Pub Draw</i>.</p>

				<span class="card-title">Podcasts</span>
				<p>I listen to podcasts often while doing chores or working on homework. My most played is probably Above & Beyond's Group Therapy.</p>

				<span class="card-title">Biking</span>
				<p>When it gets warmer and I have more free time after the semester ends, I want to reteach myself how to bike. I never learned as a kid; I lived on a pretty steep hill.</p>
